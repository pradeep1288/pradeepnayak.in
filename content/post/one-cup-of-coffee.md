I always enjoy good coffee, but I love it when I make some myself. For the last few months or so, I have been making cofee at home. I first started of with a cheap coffee maker, and some beans pre-ground from the grocery store. This was okay for a while, but things changed when I began to try pour over coffee at different coffee store. This began into an obsession and started reading more about coffee beans, where coffee comes from, different brewing methods etc. I was convinced now to throw away my cheap coffee maker. It was time to begin investing into my own little coffee setup at home. One of the decisions I took earlier on was that I didn't want to compromise on the quality. 

## Equipment Setup
* The first step to making good coffee at home was to buy a good burr grinder at home. I ended up picking up the [Baratza Encore](https://www.baratza.com/grinder/encore/) grinder based on multiple recommendations and online reviews. It costed roughly around ~139$. It's simple, straightforward and intuitive to use. The grinds are great!
* The next thing was picking up a pour over equipment and I chose Chemex as the option to begin with as the learning curve is easier on this one. 
* Making coffee at home is basically performing a chemistry experiment. You need to get the measurements right. The perfect amout of coffee and it has to be brewed at the right temperatur. I picked up a goose neck kettle from [coffee gator]() which had a therometer with it to measure the temperature. For the weighing scale, I picked that up from coffee gator too.

## Coffee Beans
This is a huge topic by itself and a single post is not enough. I myself do not understand the technicality of the whole coffee beans market. The origin of the bean, region from where it is from, the roast influences how the cup tastes. I have tried coffee's from South American countries like Guatamala, El Salvador, Colombia, Peru to coffee beans from African countries like Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Zambia. There is a unique distinction between each of these coffee's and they have a unique
characteristic to them. It's like they have a story to tell you :) 

## Coffee Roasters
Each roaster is unique and have a speciality of their own. The things I often look are that they have fair trade practices and source their beans directly from coffee farmers around the world. Some of the roasters who I like and have tired so far are:

* Round Hill Roastery
* Mormouth 
* Verve Coffee Roasters
* Andy Town Coffee Roasters
* Onyx Coffee Lab
* SW roasting
* Contraband
* Sidecar

## Experience
Once I had all this setup, it was basically about experimenting and figuring out what worked best for me. It took me multiple attempts to learn and understand whats the correct grind size, the right temperature, the coffee to water ratio and the pour time. I now think I have a decent recepie which I feel comfortable with. Making coffee is a very therapeatic experience for me right from the sound of grinding the beans, watching the coffee breathe during the bloom phase and the smell
of fresh coffee! 

This whole experience of making good coffee at home has turned into a ritual. Every single day, I religiously grind my beans, and make coffee in my pour over device of my choice for the kind of coffee beans I have. This has been very rewarding and has had a very possitive impact on me. I have invested more and added the Fellow Stag Kettle, Kalita wave and harrio v60 drippers to my collection. The only thing which I have been missing now is the perfect hand grinder. I am currently eyeing at
the commandante which is deemed to be the best hand grinder in the world and its made in germany!!
